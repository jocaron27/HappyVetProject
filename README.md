# About

Happy Vet: Finding a vet for your pet is one of the most challenging things to do.  We want our furry friends to be provided with the best and most professional care we can!  So, imagine if we could leverage the style of Tinder to find the best professional that meets your petâ€™s profile based off their match potential.  Swipe right/left on vets, and schedule appointment dates for your pet.
